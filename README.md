# A new Star Wars game

A bunch of noobs who don't know how to make games attempt to make a star wars game. 

They shall succeed.

Hello Kate, 

This is a guide that will describe how to see this rad game that we have been making in the browser. 

Step 1: 

Open up the application "Terminal", not quite sure why it's called that but it sounds rather ominous really. 

When you have this open, you will be in a directory, it will most likely be your 'home' directory. I suggest changing
to your Desktop. You can do this by typing the following magical computer letters. 

`cd ~/Desktop`

When you are in this location of your computer you may then do the following:

`git clone https://github.com/learntocodemeetup/learntocodemeetup.github.io.git `

This will hit the hyperdrive and fetch you the game (at the speed of light or perhaps a bit slower). 

Once that seems done - then you will need to change into that directory. 

It will be something like ...

I suggest typing in 

`cd learn` 

and then pressing tab, to auto-complete. If it autocompletes, it's probably the right one. 

When you are in this directory type in 

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`

If this step doesn't work you might not have Python, but I think you should have it by default. You can check by typing in:

`python --version`

Then go to the browser and type in:

`localhost:8080`

If this works I have explained my instructions well, if not, you will have to use your imagination to see how wonderful our creation is. 

Daniel
