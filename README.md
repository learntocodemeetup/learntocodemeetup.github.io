#Some notes taken 6 December 2015, with Lukas, Brianna, Daniel

Should probably have a way to win

What is the ideal time for a game? Five minutes makes it easily playable for most people.

Should there be one path to victory, i.e one stopping point, or should there be lots of stopping points that are considered successful. 

How does the choice of character effect the storyline? Does each character have a different story, or do they just influence the story. 

Characters probably shouldn’t be able to talk/interact/fight with themselves!

Battle of Hoth

Game starts with the “Battle of Hoth” beginning. The rebel alliance characters i.e Luke, Han, Chewbacca, Leia etc are caught off guard. The empire characters Darth Vader, Stormtrooper start making the surprise attack on the rebel base. 

Perhaps we can have ‘timed events’ where all characters basically sync up, and then in between those events they take paths that lead away from the main story line. 

Possibly story path of a Stormtrooper
Starts either on a Rebel Ship, or on the ground at Hoth
Could either stay on the ground, or get in the AT-AT. 

If they choose to go in an AT-AT they might get taken down by the harpoons and tow cabels. 

If the harpoon and tow cable is used, the stormtrooper (who is controlling the AT-AT) can either keep moving forward and fall down (end screen) or they can stop and get out. 

The stormtrooper then eventually makes its way into the rebel base. A choice here might be “Stay with Darth Vader or go on your own”.

If you go on your own, you find C3-PO and you can take him out. 
Whether you hit him or miss him could be down to randomness. 

If you hit him, then the ship won’t take off, because C3-PO isn’t there to fix it. 

Notes: Use randomness for events that could go either way, i.e shooting at someone. 

Use music/sound effects to create tension/drama. 

Rebel Alliance Characters - Han

Starts at rebel base, becomes aware of threat via intelligence of imperial probe droids. 

Could choose to fix Millenium Falcon or abandon it and go with the rest of the fleet. 

(If he goes with the rest of the fleet he will end up not making it)

His “success” screen will be making it out of the base via the Millenium Falcon.
